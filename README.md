Built an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for an ML batch inference system. New data or Script updation automatically triggers inference, generates predictions, computes evaluation metrics, detects data and concept drift, logs monitoring reports, and versions all artifacts using GitHub Actions. The system is idempotent, supports continuous data integration, and mirrors real-world MLOps batch deployment patterns.
